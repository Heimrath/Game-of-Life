# Game-of-Life
Reproduction of John Horton Conway's Game of Life in C

## Introduction
<p>
  In this game, we can position cells around the matrix, and then monitor future generations according to the rules of the game. </br></br>
  Our program has data persistence, which allows the user to save, load or delete a previously saved generation. </br></br>
  The first thing the user are going to do is type the size of the matrix (from 10 to 60)

## Including living cells
  <p>
    After selecting option 3 (three), you can choose to include living cells by typing a line and a column. You can also exclude a cell by typing one cell already included. </br>
    After you finish, you just need to type 0 0 to return to the main menu.

  Living cells -> ... </br>
  Dead cells -> ... </br>
